### PB-Track (Pitney Bowes Tracking API Wrapper in PHP)

This is the adventure of a 16-year old trying to find his package; In his rage toward the shipping company, he decided to create an API wrapper for his language of choice, PHP, in order to receive more detailed information as to the whereabouts of his package.

----

Use of the wrapper is pretty simple, and examples can be found in `examples/`, while the wrapper itself can be found in `lib/`.
